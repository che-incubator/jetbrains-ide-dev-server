This project allows you to use your local JetBrains IDE connected to your remote development environment running in Eclipse Che.

In Che-specific terms, this project represents an Eclipse Che editor based on IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.

To connect the local JetBrains IDE with the in-cluster dev server, see the [JetBrains Gateway plugin](https://github.com/redhat-developer/devspaces-gateway-plugin/).

## Images

To build a container image:

```

[quay.io/che-incubator/che-idea-dev-server:next](https://quay.io/repository/che-incubator/che-idea-dev-server?tab=tags) is built and published each time a new change is merged to the `main` branch.

[quay.io/che-incubator/che-idea-dev-server:latest](https://quay.io/repository/che-incubator/che-idea-dev-server?tab=tags) is built and published for each new project release.

## Troubleshooting
Integration of Jet Brains Gateway with Eclipse Che this editor provides is in the early stage. So, you may face some problems that require a manual resolution.

**Problem 1:** executing `oc port-forward ...` command reports an error:
```
error: error upgrading connection: pods "..." is forbidden: User "..." cannot create resource "pods/portforward" in API group "" in the namespace "..."
```
**Solution:** ask the admin to allow port forwarding for your user.

**Problem 2:** when typing in the editor, a popup reports an error:
```
No internet connection
```
**Solution:** check your terminal if the port forwarding is enabled.

**Problem 3:** executing `oc port-forward ...` command reports an error:
`Error from server (NotFound): pods "..." not found`

**Solution:** check the Dashboard that your workspace is running.
